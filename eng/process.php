          <h3>Quality Management</h3>
          <p>
          01<br> By directly producing pellet as a raw material from the initial stage, the impurities can be removed. And by using the pellet to produce plate and mold manufacturing lines, it minimizes the defect of the finished product. Even if the order quantity is large, we maintain consistent quality of the finished product.
          <br><br>
          02<br> We automatize most of our production process such as extrude and cutting, so that we can provide consistent quality of the products.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="procolor">
          03<br>To control quality, we keep track of quality processes from the stage of introduction of waste materials to shipment.
          <br><br>
          04<br>During quality inspection, we do not only test basic properties and specifications, but reproduce some of the customer's assembly process as it is and make a prototype.
